# Analizador / CondeTranslatorToC

So this is a "programming language" that i developed in the school the object code for it is in C so that's the outcome of the compilation of the code.

the way you can use it is going to my web page (https://willis65260.github.io/portfolio/) then go to "what have i done?" tab click on the "JavaScript"
and there you can find some sample code but if you wanna do further use of it you'll need to use the grammar

in the .docx file you can look for the breakdown of the grammar this is useful only if you want to improve it in some way

this web page was used for the final release due to the complexity of the grammar

i have some videos that explain the code (spanish):
